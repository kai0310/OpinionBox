## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

All users should be able to report vulnerabilities and areas that need to be fixed via issues if they are found. 
We will comment on the issue as needed to address it.
